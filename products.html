Dismounting his horse, he embraces the leper and is filled with a sense of compassion as he realized this is Jesus coming to him. From then on he started living simply, devoted to poverty. He began visiting hospitals and helping the poor. In San Damiano, Christ spoke to him in a church instructing Francis to repair the church, however Francis took this <em>too</em> literally. Selling most of his father's cloth inventory, Francis began repairing the church. Disowned by his father, Francis took off all his clothes in the town square 'giving everything back to you [Chirst].' Francisco handed his clothes to his father and walked away naked, announcing his marriage to poverty and Jesus.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">Francis had finally rid himself of his father's wealth in his extravagant display. He was now fully invested in the church, completely devoted to God. With focus on a lady he called 'Lady Poverty,' Francis gathered a group of friends called Franciscans to spread his message. As the Franciscans grew rapidly, Francis sent missionaries to Tunis and Morocco. It has been documented that Francis was very good with words, often quoted saying 'Preach the gospel, use words when necessary.' He loved nature, preached to the birds and even tamed a fierce wolf! As his life began coming to an end, Francis suffered eye problems and later recieved the stigmata - the wounds of Christ.</p>
